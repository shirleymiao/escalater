# Escalater

Escalater is an anonymous incident reporting tool for Slack. Slack users who wish to report an incident can send a message to the Escalater Bot, specifying the group of users they would like to report the incident to, such as HR managers. Their message is sent anonymously to the group, who can reply to the incident via a thread and maintain an anonymous discussion with the reporter. Organizations can view the collection of incidents that have been reported by their members via an accompanying web app.
